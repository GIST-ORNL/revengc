Description: A wealth of open source information is available that points to building usage including floor area of building size and likely occupancy. In the case of residential structures, census data provides a number of attributes including two values important to interior density estimation: household size (hhs) and size of house (soh or area). If a national census revealed the raw data or provided a full contingency table (hhs x area), computing interior density as people/area would be straightforward. However, agencies rarely report this contingency table. Rather hhs and area are often decoupled and reported as separate univariate frequency tables, average values, or a combination of the two.  In addition, tables are typically left (<), right (>), and interval (-) censored further complicating the process and obscuring the original relationship between hhs and area.  For example, if a census reports a hhs average of 5.3, it is known that this average was calculated based off some houses being above and below 5.3.  So how many houses have 1 person, 2 people,., 5 people?  Censoring distorts data the same way.  If a census reports that there are 100 houses in an area of 26-50 square meters, then how many houses are in 26, 27,.., 50 square meters?  The challenge therefore is to infer what the original data could have been in the given summarized information. A statistical approach based on the bivariate Poisson distribution was designed to reverse engineer censored, decoupled census data into a likely hhs x area contingency table for estimating interior residential occupancy.
